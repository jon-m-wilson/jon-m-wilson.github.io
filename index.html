	<h1>Jon Wilson</h1>
	
	<p>I am a third year PhD student at Durham University. My advisor is <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/mathematical.sciences/people/profile/?id=11341" target="_blank"><u>Anna Felikson</u></a>.</p>
	<p>Broadly I am interested in Geometry, Combinatorics and Algebra. In particular, I'm attracted to topics with a cluster algebra flavour.
	More on this can be found <a href="/research">here. </a></p>
