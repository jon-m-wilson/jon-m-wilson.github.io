	<p>Throughout my studies I have been exploring cluster structures on non-orientable surfaces.
	Many questions posed to cluster algebras make sense for this modified setting, moreover, often the answers .
	For instance, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05419" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> I showed finite type 
	quasi-cluster algebras have spherical exchange graphs.</p>
	
	<p>Currently I am most interested in finding combinatorial descriptions of these cluster structures
	which also encompass cluster algebras.</p>
