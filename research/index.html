	<p>Throughout my studies I have been exploring cluster structures on non-orientable surfaces.
	Many questions posed to cluster algebras make sense for this modified setting, moreover, the answers often prove to be quite similar!
	For instance, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05419" target="_blank"> here </a> I show finite type 
	quasi-cluster algebras have spherical exchange graphs.</p>
	
	<p>Currently I am most interested in finding combinatorial descriptions of these cluster structures
	which also encompass cluster algebras.</p>
